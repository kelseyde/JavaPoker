# JavaPoker
A model of the card game poker in Java, with a focus on strong OO design and the SOLID principles.

# Features

- A poker hand evaluator engine, which determines what poker hand a player has, and compares hands to determine the winner. 
- Strong OO design. All but 3 of the classes form a card-game program that could work with any card game using the standard, 52-card deck;
  the only classes that are poker specific are the hand-evaluator, the game class, and the console runner class. 
- A command-line interface, where two players can take part in rounds of betting and dealing.
